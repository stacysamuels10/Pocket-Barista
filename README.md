"Pocket Barista" is a mobile website to allow users to track their home coffee habits. They can track their cups, coffee bags, brewers, and grinders while learning new brewing methods and new roasteries.

## **Requirements**

Pocket Barista is deployed online, so all you need is this [link](). It is designed to be used on your phone for ease of use while your brewing your coffee so it is best viewed on a mobile device. This site is a personal project to advance my skills in React/Redux. I was inspired to recreate an app that I use often called Coffee Book. The deployment is meant for ease of viewing on my personal portfolio and not intended to infringe on copyrighted material.

## How Pocket Barista Works

---

### Wesbite Overview

Pocket Barista utilizes a front-end library consisting of React and Redux. Users can track every cup they brew, every bag of coffee they buy, and every brewer and grinder they own. They can also learn new methods of brewing through brew guides and each month new roasters are featured on the homepage. Users can also access their data using redux persist(as long as you are on the same browser session) to view every past brew and bag so they can make that 5 star cup over and over again. The Pocket Barista is all about creating an app that can be used by people who are passionate about coffee and on that forever quest for the perfect cup of coffee.

### Website Features

Here are some of the website's features in greater detail:

- A modern and simple design that utilizes MUI framework.
- Users can record many different aspects about their cup of coffee and rate each cup.
- Users can browse the history of every cup of coffee and coffee bag and equipment piece they own!

## The Chuck Wagon In Development

This website represents the fourth major project in our Digital Crafts coursework. "The Chuck Wagon" is intended to demonstrate a clear understanding of using React.js as a front-end framework. For demo purposes, all information is stored in redux-persist storage; however, the application can easily be converted into pulling and placing information into a database.

Here are some ways I would continue to develop "The Chuck Wagon":

- Hooking the website to a backend library for a more relevant storage solution.
- Hooking the website to a purchasing API to better simulate an online transaction.
- Creating a login function where users can maintain a profile along with an order history and a "favorites" page.
